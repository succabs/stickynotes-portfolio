# ðŸŽ§ Funky Portfolio

This is a repository for my portfolio website. Created using Astro. No other frameworks were used.

Continuous Deployment is made to my VPS with GitHub Actions.

The design style is heavily inspired by Jet Set Radio Future and neobrutalism.

Still very much a work in progress.
