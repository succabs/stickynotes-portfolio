# ðŸŽ§ Sticky Notes Portfolio

This is a repository for my portfolio website. Created using Astro. No other frameworks were used.

Continuous Deployment is made to my VPS with GitHub Actions on every push to main branch.

Still very much a work in progress. A project to tinker with when I am not too tired to code after work.

## ðŸ‘€ What's next? (Mainly a vague to-do list for myself)

- Design
- Icons to sun/moon
- Navbar styling (active links underlined)
- paddings and margins?
- color scheme
- dark mode colors
- cards for projects & blog posts
- blog post styling
- tags link for blog front page
- Content
