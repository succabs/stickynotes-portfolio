# ðŸŽ§ Funky Beats & Neon Lights

This is a repository for my portfolio website. Created using Astro. No other frameworks were used.

Continuous Deployment is made to my VPS with GitHub Actions on every push to main branch.

Still very much a work in progress. A project to tinker with when I am not too tired to code after work.

## ðŸ‘€ What's next? (Mainly a vague to-do list for myself)

- Design
- Icons from sun/moon to spray can / neon light
- Different elements like graffitis on JSRF
- Navbar styling
- paddings and margins
- color scheme
- footer styling
- button styling
- cards for projects & blog posts
- blog post styling
- tags link for blog front page
- Content
