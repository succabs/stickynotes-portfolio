## Introduction

Welcome to my journey of designing and styling my portfolio website. In this post, we'll dive into the creative process behind crafting a unique design that stands out in the realm of web development. While the technical aspects of building and deploying my site with Astro on my own VPS and GitHub Actions are important, this post primarily focuses on the aesthetics and design elements that make it distinct.

## The Sticky Notes Influence and Neobrutalism

During the development of my portfolio, I explored numerous design ideas and color palettes. Eventually, I stumbled upon the concept of sticky notes. These small, everyday items intrigued me, as they offered a simple yet creative way to showcase my work. It was a departure from the conventional, as many developer and designer portfolios often felt like carbon copies or overly complex.

The influence of neobrutalism also played a significant role in shaping the design. Neobrutalism's raw, minimalistic, and functional characteristics resonated with me, and I incorporated elements of it into my portfolio.

## Research and Inspiration

To make the sticky notes on my portfolio appear as though they were attached to a whiteboard, I delved into research to create the right visual effects. This involved experimenting with shadows, highlights, and subtle textures to achieve the desired effect.

## Choosing the Fonts

Selecting the appropriate fonts was crucial in maintaining the sticky note aesthetic. For headings, I opted for "Permanent Marker," which exudes a handwritten charm. The body text font, "Comic Neue," complements the playful nature of sticky notes, ensuring that the content is easily readable and approachable.

## Crafting the Color Palette

Crafting the color palette was a straightforward process. I drew inspiration from actual sticky notes. By using ready-made color palettes derived from images of sticky notes, I ensured a consistent and visually appealing color scheme that resonated with my vision.

## Backgrounds and Textures

My portfolio's design remains clean and uncluttered. The background is a subtle off-white shade, allowing the colorful sticky notes to take center stage. These sticky notes, in various shades and shapes, appear as if they are "popping" off the background, creating a dynamic and engaging visual experience.

## Conclusion

In retrospect, the journey of designing my portfolio was an enjoyable and creative endeavor. The inspiration drawn from sticky notes and the influence of neobrutalism made this project unique and rewarding. It stands as a testament to the power of design to captivate and engage visitors in a fun and memorable way. This project has been one of the most delightful custom endeavors I've undertaken in a while, and I look forward to sharing it with the world.

Thank you for joining me on this design exploration journey.
