## Introduction

Welcome to my portfolio website, where design and creativity converge. In this blog post, I'm excited to take you behind the scenes of the design process that brought this website to life. Inspired by the colorful, energetic world of Jet Set Radio Future (JSRF), this design journey has been a thrilling adventure. I'll walk you through the research, font choices, color palette, and other elements that went into creating this unique and vibrant site.

## The JSRF Influence

From the moment I embarked on this design project, the influence of Jet Set Radio Future was clear. The game's graffiti art, dynamic visuals, and urban energy became my guiding light. JSRF's bold, vibrant colors, and its celebration of street culture set the tone for my website's aesthetic.

## Research and Inspiration

Before diving into the design, research played a crucial role. I delved deep into the world of JSRF, revisiting the game, studying its art, and understanding its cultural references. This immersive research helped me capture the essence of the game's design style. It became the foundation for the creative decisions that followed.

## Choosing the Fonts

Selecting fonts was a pivotal decision in bringing the JSRF vibe to the website. "Bangers" quickly became the top choice for headings, with its bold and graffiti-inspired style. To maintain readability and contrast, I paired it with "Lato" for body text, as its clean and modern look offered a perfect balance.

## Crafting the Color Palette

Creating a color palette that echoed JSRF's bold hues was a thrilling challenge. Bright blues, fiery reds, sunny yellows, and vivid greens found their place in the palette. These bold colors, combined with stark blacks and whites, set the stage for a website that's alive with energy and attitude.

## Backgrounds and Textures

To capture the essence of JSRF's urban environment, I introduced textures reminiscent of graffiti and city streets. Subtle overlays of concrete and asphalt textures added depth and visual interest to the design. The use of street art-inspired elements helped tie everything together.

## Animations and Interactivity

Animations brought the site to life, mimicking the dynamic energy of JSRF. Subtle animations, like graffiti elements appearing on hover, added an interactive touch without overwhelming the user experience. It was a delightful challenge to create animations that enhanced the site's appeal.

## Conclusion

Designing my portfolio with the influence of JSRF has been an exhilarating journey. The vibrant colors, bold fonts, and street art-inspired visuals all come together to create a design that pays homage to the game's unique aesthetic while showcasing my work and skills. I hope this post has given you insights into the thought process behind the design, and I invite you to explore my portfolio to see the final result.

Thank you for joining me on this creative adventure, and I look forward to sharing more about my work and projects in the future.
